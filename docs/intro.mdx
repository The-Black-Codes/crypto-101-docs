## Getting Started

Clone the [repo](https://github.com/the-black-codes/crypto-101) and let's get started!

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Black-Codes/crypto-101.git
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

## Install the deps

From the project root directory

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`yarn`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`npm install`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start your site

Run the development server to ensure React is working as expected!

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`yarn start`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">{`npm run start`}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
